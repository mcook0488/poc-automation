## Objective

The automation framework of the Selenium WebDriver will perform the test script of verifying that the APIs for the 'Google' search engine successfully find related news articles, images and pages of animals and wildlife.

The 'Google' search engine is planned to be a part of the testing in order to confirm that these sanity checks can be integrated within the projects automation framwork.

The automation framework will be run for all web browsers with the use of the Selenium WebDriver, including Google Chrome.

## Execution

The type of testing will carried out by the automation framework will mostly be based on unit testing of a single module and sanity checks to confirm that no new fixes or updates have caused any defects for the critical path.

The automation testing will begin at the start of the sprint when a new build has been uploaded in the project to verify that the build has passed all of the sanity checks to confirm it is ready to be released for manual testing.

## Resources

Selenium WebDriver and Eclipse IDE will be confirmed as the suite and tool to be used for the automation framework. These are open-sourced tools which means it will not be any cost to the company to set up, with exception of acquiring the individual(s) to perform the task. 

## Results

After performing the test script [Google-Search-Test.md], the automation test successfully performed a search on the 'Google' engine for the keyword "Animal". This was performed on the Chrome Driver for the Selenium WebDriver.
