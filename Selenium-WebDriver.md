## Selenium WebDriver

Selenium is the most popular open-source automated testing suites for web-based applications across all the major web browsers. This makes the automation suite perfect for performing acceptance testing for the 'Google' search engine.

For this automation test, Selenium WebDriver will be installed with the Eclipse IDE tool in order to create the Google search test script. Selenium WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows the user to execute tests against many different web browsers, including Google Chrome, Edge and Safari. The Selenium WebDriver supports multiple programming languages but for this test script, Java will be used.

## Benefits of Selenium WebDriver

There are a number of benefits for using Selenium WebDriver as the automation framework which include:

- Simple architecture that controls the browser for the OS level.
- The architecture only requires the programming language's IDE and a web browser.
- The web browser's engine controls the Selenium WebDriver.
- Selenium WebDriver supports all of the available web browsers for automation testing.
- Page elements interactions are far more relasitic where the test scripts apply the automation testing similar to the interaction of an end user.

## Eclipse IDE

Eclipse is an integrated development environment which is used in computer programming as an IDE for the Java language.

## Installing Selenium WebDriver with Java on Eclipse IDE

1. Download and install the *Java Software Development Kit* from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.
2. After completing the installation, open the command prompt and type "Java".
3. Confirm that the output verifies that the 32-bit and 64-bit data models are available.
4. Go to http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ and download the 'Eclipse IDE' tool.
5. After downloading the tool, locate the *eclipse-inst-win64" exe file from the desktop.
6. Launch the file and select the *Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" option from the Eclipse Installer.
7. Successfully install the Eclipse IDE and launch the tool.
8. On http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/, download the *Selenium Java Client Driver* from the Language list.
9. Return to the 'Eclipse IDE' tool where the "Select a workspace" pop-up box should be displayed.
10. Accept the default workspace in order to continue.
11. To create a new project, go to *File > New > Java Project* and then name the new project.
12. Right-click on the new project and select *New > Package* and then name the new package.
13. Now create a new Java class by right-clicking the new package and then selecting *New > Class* to create the new class.
14. The new class should now be available under the new project and package on 'Eclipse IDE'.
15. To configure the WebDriver in to the Java Build Path, right-click on the new project, select *Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries* and then clcik on the *Add External JARs.." option.
Locate all of the JAR files to add from the pop-up window and add them them to the Java Build Path.
Select the *Apply and Close* option to apply the JAR files to the properties dialogue.
The Selenium WebDriver libraries will now have been imported to the Java Build Path.
